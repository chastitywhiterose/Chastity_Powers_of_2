This program was an experiment to see if I could play audio files to represent each of the decimal digits in my powers of two program. It actually worked very well and I was able to use code from Chaste Panel to load and play the audio.

I used this page to get the frequencies I needed to generate the tones in Audacity

This link provides the information on which frequencies equal which notes on the traditional musical scale.
