The C Programming Language is more than enough for me as a language. My 3 puzzle games: Chaste Tris, Chaste Puyo, and Chaste Panel were all written using C with the SDL library.

While I am satisfied with C, I also want to learn a bit more of C++ out of curiosity. The best part is that my C programs serve as the foundation of my C++ programs.
